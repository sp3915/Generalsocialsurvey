We want to find the wealth distribution across different race,religion and political party affiliation. Does any race, religion, etc have an advantage over others? The questions we would like to answer are listed below. 1.1 Overview How the average income change over the years? Did any race show significant growth in income compared to others? How does income distribute across different political party affiliation and its change over time? Is there any dependency between religion and political parties affiliation? Does watching more TV suggest lower income? Do old people tend to watch more TV than younger people? Does marital status affect the amount of time someone watches TV? Does a Christianity have a bias for race and martial status ?

The General Social Survey (GSS) is a project of NORC at the University of Chicago, with principal funding from the National Science Foundation. Since 1972, the GSS has been monitoring societal change and studying the growing complexity of American society. The GSS is a publicly available national resource, and is one of the most frequently analyzed sources of information in the social sciences. 2.2 Data The data has 21483 records and 9 variables. Variables are as follows- Year, age and tvhours are numerical. rincome is categorical in income range. marital status, race, party affiliation, religion, denomination are categorical variables. ## # A tibble: 10 x 9 ## year marital age race rincome partyid relig denom tvhours ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 2000 Never married 26 White $8000 to 9999 Ind,nea~ Prote~ South~ 12 ## 2 2000 Divorced 48 White $8000 to 9999 Not str~ Prote~ Bapti~ NA ## 3 2000 Widowed 67 White Not applicable Indepen~ Prote~ No de~ 2 ## 4 2000 Never married 39 White Not applicable Ind,nea~ Ortho~ Not a~ 4 ## 5 2000 Divorced 25 White Not applicable Not str~ None Not a~ 1 ## 6 2000 Married 25 White $20000 - 24999 Strong ~ Prote~ South~ NA ## 7 2000 Never married 36 White $25000 or more Not str~ Chris~ Not a~ 3 ## 8 2000 Divorced 44 White $7000 to 7999 Ind,nea~ Prote~ Luthe~ NA ## 9 2000 Married 44 White $25000 or more Not str~ Prote~ Other 0 ## 10 2000 Married 47 White $25000 or more Strong ~ Prote~ South~ 3 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We have selected the related variables and transformed them into the required format to address our questions from introduction, by dplyr package functions such as mutate(), select(), filter(), group_by(), etc. Example- rincome column being categorical in income range is being converted to numerical by taking average numerical value of the groups income range. This converted numerical is being used to plot graphs. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values From the missing data plots one can see that tvhours column is the only field where we have missing values and it is roughly equal to 47% from the graph. Since the percentage is very high we cannot impute the values, therefore we would be deleting the rows when using tvhours as a statistic All other columns are good to use "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Income 5.2 Religion vs Party-ID 5.3 TV Hours 5.4 Race, Religion &amp; Marital status", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Income First, let us observe the number of respondents in each bucket of income. We can see that the number of respondents are the highest in $25,000 or more bucket. The percentage of respondents with 10,000 or more income is higher than the other categories. There are significant number of respondents whose income is not known as seen in the distribution. Now, let us check the trend in the average annual income from 2000 to 2014. For this graph, we have considered the average of bucket size to get a numeric value of income. For the $25,000 or above bucket, we assumed a value of $50,000. Also, the values whose income is unknown have been removed for this analysis. The average US income in 2014 is approximately $55,000 as per census. However, since we made few assumptions, the average in 2014 came out to be $36,000 which can be still good for the analyzing the trend. Here, we can observe that the average income increased from 2000 to 2008 and there is a sudden dip in 2010. We suspect that this could be due to the 2008 Financial crisis post which we can observe a rapid growth again. Now, let us observe the trend in average income differentiating it by race. Here, we want to check if there is income inequality based on race historically and how did it change over time. From above we see that the income inequality between White and Black is approximately same in 2014 when compared to 2000. This could be due to the fact that there is a sudden decrease in average income of Black and other races from 2012 to 2014 where the income increased for White race. This could also be due to inconsistency in the data. However, we cannot conclude just based on the available data. An interesting observation to notice is that, the average income of other races has dropped the highest in 2010 and is very dynamic compared to other races. Now let us check the average income of respondents who support a particular political party. Here, we can observe that the average income of respondents supporting Republican party have higher average income than the respondents supporting Democrats. However, the difference is not significant suggesting the fact the political party affiliation and income are not dependent on each other. On a similar note, let us check if religion has an impact on person`s political party affiliation. For that, we have combined multiple religion categories into smaller groups for better visualization. 5.2 Religion vs Party-ID We observe that the percentage of Republican party supporters are highest in Christianity whereas the percentage of Democrat party supporters are highest in the respondents who are Jews and Muslims. Also, the percentage of independent candidate supporters are significant in each category who can either incline towards Democrats or Republicans which suggests that the party which is able to convert most of independent votes has the advantage of winning the elections. Now let us go aback to income and check it based on religion and race at the same time. For this visualization, we have assumed income less than $10,000 to be Below Poverty and income greater than $10,000 as Above Poverty. Also, the religions have been condensed to Christianity vs Others for a simpler visualization. Here, the first observation is that the percentage of respondents who are Christian is significantly high which can be observed from the width of the plot. We can see that the percentage of respondents who are below poverty line is not significantly different between Christian and other religion. However, the percentage of respondents who are above poverty line are higher in White race in both religions. Christian Black race has lower Below Poverty percentage than Other Black race. 5.3 TV Hours Now, let us check some other dimensions of the given data. We would like check the dependencies between the variables Income, Age and Number of TV hours. In specific we would like to answer the following questions: 1. Is there a particular age group that has high income? 2. Do old people tend to watch more TV? 3. Does watching more TV indicate a lower income? Let us answer these questions by observing the following scatter plot. In each axis we can see that the blue dots are concentrated on either ends of each horizontal line which indicates that the income of older people and younger people is less compared to the middle age earning professionals. We can see that the points with higher TV Hours values are concentrated on the upper left of the graph which indicates that the younger people watch more TV than old people which is counter intuitive to our assumption. In any given vertical line, the number of blue dots are increasing as we go up. This indicates that watching more TV corresponds to lower income. Or the other way to think about this could be, lower income respondents have more leisure time to watch TV. Now, let us compare the dependencies between Marital Status,Religion, TV Hours and Income. We would like to answer the following questions: 1. Do single people watch more TV than married people? 2. Do respondents belonging to a particular religion watch more TV? Here, we observe that the single people tend to watch more TV than Married people. The difference is not very significant in Christianity which is majority of our data. Hence, we cannot conclusively say that single people watch more TV than married people. However, the Below Poverty line respondents tend to watch more TV as observed from the previous plot as well. From the above graph, there is no impact of religion is not very relevant in Single people. However, married people of Other religions tend to watch more TV compared to married people in Christianity. This leads to an interesting question that does religion and race have relation with relationship status of people? 5.4 Race, Religion &amp; Marital status From above we observe that the percentage of Single respondents is lesser in Christianity than other religions. Also, the percentage of Single people is lower in White race compared to other races. Respondents belonging to Christianity and White race are less probable to be Single than respondents belonging to White race and other religion. Though the plot provides a visual proof, we cannot decisively comment on these aspects as they are sensitive and require more study to get conclusive results.

The plot also allows us to easily compare the trend with another category and helps us see the difference in trends The wealth distribution across different race, religion and political party affiliation can be clearly seen. Comparing any race, religion, etc also tells us whether any class had an economical advantage over others.
