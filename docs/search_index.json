We would be trying to answer questions like: How the average income change over the years? How does income distribute across different age groups and its change over time? Did any race show significant growth in income compared to others? Does marital status have an effect on income? Does watching more TV suggest lower income? Do old people tend to watch more TV than younger people? Does marital status affect the amount of time someone watches TV?

Are there any dependencies between religion and political parties?
