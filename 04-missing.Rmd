# Missing values


```{r}
source("codes/plotmissing.R")
plot_missing(gss_cat,TRUE)
```

From the missing data plots one can see that tvhours column is the only field where we have missing values and it is roughly equal to 47% from the graph. 
Since the percentage is very high we cannot impute the values, therefore we would be deleting the rows when using tvhours as a statistic.
